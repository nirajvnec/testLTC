Sure! Below are the complete steps and code required to create a C# class, expose it to COM, and register the resulting DLL so that it can be used in VBA.Step 1: Create a C# Class LibraryOpen Visual Studio.Create a New Project:Select Class Library as the project template.Name the project (e.g., MyCarLibrary).Add the Car Class:Replace the contents of the Class1.cs file with the following code:using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

// Ensure the class is visible to COM
[ComVisible(true)]
[Guid("3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301")] // Replace with your unique GUID
[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]
public class Car : ICar
{
    public int GetNumberOfWheel()
    {
        return 4; // Assume all cars have 4 wheels
    }
}

// Interface to expose the methods to COM
[ComVisible(true)]
[InterfaceType(ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIDispatch)]
public interface ICar
{
    int GetNumberOfWheel();
}Build the Project:Press Ctrl+Shift+B to build the project. This will generate a DLL file in the bin\Debug or bin\Release folder.Step 2: Register the DLL for COMOpen Developer Command Prompt:In Windows, search for "Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio" and open it.Navigate to the DLL Directory:Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where the DLL is located (e.g., cd C:\path\to\MyCarLibrary\bin\Debug).Register the DLL:Run the following command to register the DLL for COM:regasm /codebase MyCarLibrary.dll/codebase: This argument specifies that the assembly should be registered with its file path. This is necessary if the assembly is not in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).Step 3: Use the C# Class in VBAOpen Excel (or another Office application) and go to the VBA editor by pressing Alt + F11.Add a Reference to the DLL:Go to Tools > References.Click Browse..., navigate to the DLL you registered (MyCarLibrary.dll), and select it.Write VBA Code to Use the Car Class:You can now create an instance of the Car class and call its methods:Sub TestCar()
    ' Declare an object variable
    Dim myCar As Object

    ' Create an instance of the Car class
    Set myCar = CreateObject("MyCarLibrary.Car")

    ' Call the GetNumberOfWheel method
    Dim numberOfWheels As Integer
    numberOfWheels = myCar.GetNumberOfWheel

    ' Display the result
    MsgBox "Number of wheels: " & numberOfWheels
End SubSummary of Steps:Create C# Class Library:Implement the class and interface.Set ComVisible(true) and provide a unique GUID.Build and Register the DLL:Use regasm to register the DLL for COM interop.Use in VBA:Reference the DLL in VBA and instantiate the class using CreateObject.Complete Code Example:C# Code (Car.cs):using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

[ComVisible(true)]
[Guid("3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301")] // Replace with your unique GUID
[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]
public class Car : ICar
{
    public int GetNumberOfWheel()
    {
        return 4;
    }
}

[ComVisible(true)]
[InterfaceType(ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIDispatch)]
public interface ICar
{
    int GetNumberOfWheel();
}VBA Code:Sub TestCar()
    Dim myCar As Object
    Set myCar = CreateObject("MyCarLibrary.Car")
    Dim numberOfWheels As Integer
    numberOfWheels = myCar.GetNumberOfWheel
    MsgBox "Number of wheels: " & numberOfWheels
End SubBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully create a .NET class, expose it to COM, and use it in VBA.
