We are encountering issues with Kerberos authentication after upgrading from Oracle 12c to Oracle 19c. Previously, everything was functioning correctly in the Oracle 12c environment.

The following error is being reported during the authentication process:


NetworkException: NA KerberosS: Authentication handshake failure at stage: Could not load file or assembly â€˜Oracle.ManagedDataAccessIOP, Version=4.122.19.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=896483f429c47342 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
Kavitha and I are currently investigating this issue but would appreciate any assistance or guidance you can provide to help us resolve it.
