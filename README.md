If the Car class is written in C#, and you want to use it in VBA, you'll need to expose the C# class to COM (Component Object Model) so that it can be accessed from VBA. This involves several steps:Step 1: Create a C# Class Library ProjectOpen Visual Studio and create a new C# Class Library project.Add the Car class to the project:using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

// Ensure the class is visible to COM
[ComVisible(true)]
[Guid("YOUR-GUID-HERE")]
[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]
public class Car : ICar
{
    public int GetNumberOfWheel()
    {
        return 4; // Assume all cars have 4 wheels
    }
}

// Interface to expose the methods to COM
[ComVisible(true)]
[InterfaceType(ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIDispatch)]
public interface ICar
{
    int GetNumberOfWheel();
}[ComVisible(true)] makes the class and interface visible to COM.[Guid("YOUR-GUID-HERE")] uniquely identifies the class. You can generate a GUID using Visual Studio's "Create GUID" tool.ICar Interface: Exposes the GetNumberOfWheel method to COM.Step 2: Build the C# Class LibraryBuild the project. This will generate a .dll file.Register the DLL for COM:Open Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio.Navigate to the folder where the .dll was built.Register the DLL using regasm:regasm /codebase YourLibrary.dllStep 3: Use the C# Class in VBAOpen Excel (or another VBA environment).Go to Tools > References in the VBA editor.Browse and select your C# DLL.Create and use the Car object in VBA:Sub TestCar()
    ' Declare an object variable
    Dim myCar As Object

    ' Create an instance of the Car class
    Set myCar = CreateObject("YourNamespace.Car")

    ' Call the GetNumberOfWheel method
    Dim numberOfWheels As Integer
    numberOfWheels = myCar.GetNumberOfWheel

    ' Display the result
    MsgBox "Number of wheels: " & numberOfWheels
End SubReplace "YourNamespace.Car" with the appropriate ProgID (which is usually "Namespace.ClassName").Summary:C# Code: The Car class is written in C#, and exposed to COM.VBA Code: You create an instance of the C# class using CreateObject and call its methods.This setup allows you to integrate your C# class with VBA, providing you the ability to use more powerful .NET functionality within VBA applications.
