spare about 10 minutes to help me test a few issues I’m seeing in the "Riskportal" web application.

I’m having trouble with a couple of specific reports:

When I click on "IRC Report," I’m getting messages like:

"RiskNet -- Report Not Available"
"No report is available for the current CoB date"
"(File has not been uploaded in RiskNet.)"
For the "IRC Contribution Report," I get:

"ClusterNet - Access Denied"
"You are not permissioned to view this report"
