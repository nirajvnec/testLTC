Run the following command to install Angular CLI version 15.2.9 globally:
npm install -g @angular/cli@15.2.9
Explanation of Flags and Versions
--f flag: This flag stands for --force. 
It tells npm to force the installation of packages even if some conflicts or errors would generally prevent the installation.

Version 15.2.9 for Angular CLI specifies the exact version of the Angular CLI to be installed. Version 15.2.9 ensures you use a specific release with its associated features and fixes. This can be important for compatibility with your existing projects or other dependencies.

By following these steps, you will have Node.js version 18 installed, the necessary npm packages installed with force if needed, and Angular CLI version 15.2.9 installed globally.
