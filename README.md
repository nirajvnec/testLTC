2. Manual DLL Reference Removal (if added directly)


In Solution Explorer, expand the References node in your project.



Right-click on the System.Memory reference and select Remove.



This will remove the reference if you added it manually without NuGet.


3. Check packages.config (for NuGet dependencies)
   
If youâ€™re managing dependencies via packages.config, check for any entries that reference System.Memory:

Open packages.config (usually in the root of your project).
Look for:
xml
Copy code
<package id="System.Memory" version="x.x.x" targetFramework="net481" />
Remove that line if it exists.
Save the file and Restore NuGet Packages by right-clicking the solution in Solution Explorer and selecting Restore NuGet Packages.
