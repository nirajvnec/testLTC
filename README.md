I want to call api and pass page sizer and pagenumber, like whatever user has searched 

let us say user is on 10th Page and he clicks on on next page icon, and assume if the pageSize is 20 then i should reload the grid with fresh data and pass the api pageSize=20 and PageNumber=11 and then reload the grid

how can i achieve it
