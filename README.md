Hi Ashok,

We currently have the following AD groups within the CS infrastructure:

GBLADHEDANI: DSQ-ALL-00-10819CS0EnquiryToolCvaUat_GBL
CHADHEDANI: DSP-ALL-00-10819CS0EnquiryToolCvaUat_CH
EURADHEDANI: DSO-ALL-00-10819CS0EnquiryToolCvaUat_EUR
As we prepare to migrate to the UBS Workspace, could you please confirm whether these Active Directory groups and all associated users will remain accessible in their current form from the UBS Workspace and the UBS Cloud VM host?

Thank you so much for your help.
