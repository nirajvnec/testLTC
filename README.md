We are encountering issues with Kerberos authentication after upgrading from Oracle 12c to Oracle 19c. Previously, everything was functioning correctly in the Oracle 12c environment.

The following error is being reported during the authentication process:


NetworkException: NA KerberosS: Authentication handshake failure at stage: Could not load file or assembly â€˜Oracle.ManagedDataAccessIOP, Version=4.122.19.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=896483f429c47342 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
Could you please assist us in resolving this issue?
