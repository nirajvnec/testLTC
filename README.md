Generic Framework:

How does the metadata-driven dataflow in ADF improve the speed of delivery compared to traditional methods?
Can you provide more detail on how the Data Quality Assurance (DQA) framework is controlled by metadata?
What specific metrics for data quality and MER (Master Entity Resolution) are being managed?
Reusability:

Could you give examples of the types of source and target systems in UBS that the ADF data copy pipelines support?
How does the reusability of code in this framework compare to industry standards?
Are there any limitations to the types of applications or data flows that can use these reusable components?
Simplicity:

Can you elaborate on the modular logic in the code and how it ensures maintenance without impacting other parts?
What regression testing strategies are used to validate the simplicity and effectiveness of the code?
Advantages:

What specific NOPE and EOL issues does this framework address, and how does it ensure a solution-free environment?
How is the pay-as-you-go model implemented, and what are the cost implications for large-scale infrastructure?
Can you describe the security enhancements and the type of encryption used?
How is the enhanced PDI middleware different from traditional middleware solutions?
What makes ADF's core processing logic database independent, and how does this affect interoperability with different database systems?
In terms of scalability, how does the framework adapt to source and target application upgrades, such as HRDIS improvements?
How is SDB leveraged to provide a runtime view on file transfers and processing status?
