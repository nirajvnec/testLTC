Hi Siva,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that my father recently experienced two heart attacks. Yesterday, the doctor observed that his heartbeat is fluctuating and advised that he undergo immediate surgery to have a pacemaker fitted. Initially, I had booked a ticket to travel today, but after discussing with my elder brother, I have decided to postpone my travel until next week, as he will be available this week. Consequently, I have rescheduled my ticket for January 24, 2025.

In light of this, I kindly request your approval to work from home for a month, starting from January 24, 2025. Additionally, I will be off today due to the situation.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Niraj Kumar
