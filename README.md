Subject: Minutes of Meeting (MOM) - Today's Discussion

Dear All,

Please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM) for today's discussion:

No changes are required for the Excel Add-in.
A demonstration of the new C# WPF application was conducted, showcasing its ability to read Excel data and pass it to the MARS Service in JSON format.
As per Mani's suggestion, developing a new application may not be beneficial for users who are accustomed to the current Excel Add-in.
The Excel Plugin is written in VBA, and we currently lack VBA expertise within the team.
Next Steps:

Conduct an analysis of the C++ API to explore connecting via gRPC instead of CORBA (IDL).
Best Regards,
Niraj
