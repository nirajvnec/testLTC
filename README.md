Hi William,

We are migrating CS Applications (both Desktop and Web Apps) to the UBS Workspace.

We executed the attached .NET POC on a UBS Dev cloud VM but encountered access denial from GAIA/IDP.

Interestingly, the same application functions correctly when initiated from a CS machine, where the GAIA IDP prompts the user to select a User certificate in the browser.

Please advise on the necessary steps to ensure it works on UBS machines. Will there be an absence of a certificate on the UBS machines?
